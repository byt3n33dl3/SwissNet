## Overview

CrackMapExec (CME) is a powerful post-exploitation tool designed to assist penetration testers and Red Teams in their network assessments. It automates the discovery, enumeration, and exploitation of network vulnerabilities, focusing on Windows Active Directory (AD) environments.

## Features

- **Network Discovery**: Automated network scanning and host discovery.
- **Credential Validation**: Validates and leverages obtained credentials to move laterally across the network.
- **Enumeration**: Detailed enumeration of Windows systems, including shares, users, groups, sessions, and more.
- **Exploitation**: Integration with various modules to exploit known vulnerabilities.
- **Reporting**: Provides detailed output and logging for further analysis.

## Importance of the 'lib' Core

The 'lib' core of CrackMapExec is the heart of the tool, providing essential functionality that enables its various features. Here are some key components and their importance:

### 1. **Modularity and Extensibility**

The 'lib' core is designed to be modular, allowing for easy extension and customization. This makes it straightforward to add new modules or modify existing ones to tailor the tool to specific needs. This modularity is crucial for keeping up with the rapidly evolving landscape of network vulnerabilities and exploits.

### 2. **Protocol Abstraction**

CME's 'lib' core provides abstraction layers for various network protocols (e.g., SMB, RDP, LDAP). This abstraction simplifies the process of interacting with these protocols, enabling the tool to perform a wide range of actions efficiently and effectively.

### 3. **Centralized Management**

The 'lib' core centralizes the management of different functionalities, such as credential storage, module execution, and output handling. This centralized approach ensures consistency and reliability across the various operations performed by CME.
